    <p id = "diy2"> ~~~ Soak or rinse hair in Rice water which is a method that the Yao women of China have been using for centuries. Rice water also contains Vitamins B - needed for strong hair - C - needed to produce sebum which keeps the scalp moisturised - and E - prevents hair loss.
    <p id = "diy2"> ~~~ Using natural oils such as coconut, jojoba, castor, and avocado can help stimulate growth as well as prevent dandruff.
    <p id = "diy2"> ~~~Try not to brush your hair when it’s wet, it’s the main cause of hair breakage.
    <p id = "diy2"> ~~~Sleeping on a silk pillowcase protects the hair from breakage and moisture loss  while you’re sleeping.
    <p id = "diy2"> ~~~ Use an old t-shirt instead of a towel to dry your hair. Towels can cause frizz and breakage while using a t-shirt is light enough to soak up moisture while preventing the frizz. </p>
